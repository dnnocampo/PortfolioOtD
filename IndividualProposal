As the US Presidential Election reaches its final weeks, coverage of both candidates becomes more substantial. Vliegenthart, Boomgaarden, Van Aelst, and De Vreese (2010) discuss how a spike or dip in favourability for candidates is visible nearing the end of the 2008 US Presidential Election. Is the same pattern apparent in this election? Will there be a spike or dip in Trump or Clinton's favourability as news outlets such as The New York Times increase their coverage of the election?
